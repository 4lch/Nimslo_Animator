# How to use the Nimslo animator ?
- In the correct folder, install the required dependencies :
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- Make sure that all the scanned images are in the same folder, in the correct order and consecutive. The program uses the file name to determine the order in which to assemble the images.
- Drag and drop the folder that contains the images on the 'main.py' file.
- The program will show the images one by one. To select the point around which to align the images, click on every picture at that location, then press space to move to the next image.
- The assembled gifs are saved in a 'gifs' folder inside the original folder as they are being created.
